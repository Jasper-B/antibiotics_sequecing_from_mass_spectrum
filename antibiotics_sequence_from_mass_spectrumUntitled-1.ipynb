    "Not all antibiotics that are produced by organisms follow the central dogma of biology (From **DNA** to **RNA** to **proteins**). Some antibiotics (*tyrocidines* and *gramicidins*) are non-ribosomal peptides, and they are not synthesized by ribosomes but by a protein called **NRP synthetase**. This enzyme can make antibiotic peptides without relying on **RNA**. Although these antibiotic peptides can have pharmaceutical applications, they cannot be sequenced from the DNA, but instead we have to rely on mass spectrometry to identify them.\n",
